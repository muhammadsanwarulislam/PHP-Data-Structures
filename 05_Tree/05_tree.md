## Tree ##

A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes and edges, where each node has a parent (except for the root node) and zero or more children. It is a hierarchical structure that can be used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the structure of a file system, the organization of a company, or the family tree of a person. A tree can be represented in memory as an abstract data type (ADT) with operations to insert, delete, and search for nodes. The tree is a widely used data structure in computer science and can be implemented in various algorithms, including searching (e.g., binary search tree) and sorting (e.g., heap sort).
