## Explore about sorting and different types of sorting ##
Sorting means a sorted order of data set. Basically, we can sorted the data with different approach for certain criteria like the type of data set, computational complexities, memory usage, space usage, and so on. There are different kind of sorting algorithms like
  * Bubble sort
  * Insertion sort
  * Selection sort
  * Merge sort
  * Bucket sort
  * Quick sort
  A good sorting algorithm is define which is use minimum number of comparisons and swapping according to the unsorted data set.

  ## Bubble sort ##
Bubble sort is most commonly used sorting algorithm. It is comparsion-based sorting algorithm, which is always referred inefficient sorting algorithm. In bubble sort it requires maximum number of comparison.
In bubble sort, each item of the list have to compared with rest of the items and swapped if required. We can sort either ascending or descending order.
