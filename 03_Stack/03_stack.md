### Stack ###

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle**. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used in many algorithms and data structures, such as depth-first search, undo/redo operations, and function call stack in programming languages. Basic operations of a stack include push (add an element to the top of the stack), pop (remove the top element from the stack), and peek (view the top element without removing it).
