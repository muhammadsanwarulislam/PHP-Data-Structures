## Introduction

**Hello,** This repository is for those who want to learn data structures and algorithms with PHP for better control over application-solution, efficiency, and optimization.A basic understanding of PHP data types, control structures, and other basic features is required.

## Different  data structures
There are two different groups of data structures
  * Linear data structures
  * Nollinear data structures
  
In linear data structures, items are structured in a linear or sequential manner. Array, list, stack, and queue are examples of linear structures. In nonlinear structures, data are not structured in a sequential way. Graph and tree are the most common examples of nonlinear data structures.

There are many different types of data structures as like 
  * Stuck
  * Array
  * Linked list
  * Doubly linked list
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Priority queue
  * Set
  * Map
  * Tree
  * Graph
  * Heap
