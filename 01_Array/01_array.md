## Array
**An array a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations**. It's a most common data structure to execute different kind of operations. We can store multipe values in a single array as a single variable. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value. Here is a single dimension of array in the diagrams.

If we want to categorize the array, then there are mainly three types of arrays:
* Numeric array
* Associative array
* Multidimensional array
