## Array
**An array a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations**. It's a most common data structure to execute different kind of operations. We can store multipe values in a single array as a single variable. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value. Here is a single dimension of array in the diagrams.

If we want to categorize the array, then there are mainly three types of arrays:
* Numeric array
* Associative array
* Multidimensional array

## Numeric array
A numeric array does not mean it only holds numeric data.In fact, it means the indexs will be numbers only. In numeric arrays, values are store and accessed in a linear way. In PHP numeric array they can be sequential or non-sequential but they have to be numeric. Here some examples of PHP numeric array:

```
$array = [2,4,5,6,7,24];

foreach($numbers as $key => $number){
    echo "The position " .$key. " holds the value " .$number. "\n";
}
```
This will have following output:
```
The position 0 holds the value 2
The position 1 holds the value 4
The position 2 holds the value 5
The position 3 holds the value 6
The position 4 holds the value 7
The position 5 holds the value 24
```
This is a very simple example where we have an array defined and indexes are autogenerated from 0 and incremented with the value of the array. When we add a new element in the array using $array[], it actually increments the index and assigns the value in the new index. If our data is sequential, we can always use a for loop without any problem. When we say sequential, we do not mean just 0,1,2,3....,n. It can be 0,5,10,15,20,......,n where n is a multiple of 5. Or it can be 1,3,5,7,9......,n where n is odd. We can create hundreds of such sequences to make the array numeric.

A big question can be, if the indexes are not sequential, can't we construct a numeric array? Yes definitely we can. We just have to adopt a different way to iterate. Consider the following example:
```
$array = []; 
$array[10] = 100; 
$array[21] = 200; 
$array[29] = 300; 
$array[500] = 1000; 
$array[1001] = 10000; 
$array[71] = 1971; 
foreach($array as $index => $value) { 
 echo "Position ".$index." holds the value ".$value."\n"; 
}
```
If we look at the indexes, they are not sequential. They are having random indexes such as 10 followed by 21, 29, and so on. Even at the end we have the index 71, which is much smaller than the previous one of 1001. So, should the last index show in between 29 and 500? Here is the output:
```
Position 10 holds the value 100 
Position 21 holds the value 200 
Position 29 holds the value 300 
Position 500 holds the value 1000 
Position 1001 holds the value 10000 
Position 71 holds the value 1971
```
## Associative array
An associative array is accessed by a key which can be any string. In an associative array, values are stored against the key instead of a linear index. We can use an associative array to store any type of data, just like the numeric array. Let us create a student array where we will store student information:
```
$studentInfo = []; 
$studentInfo['Name'] = "muhammad"; 
$studentInfo['Age'] = 11; 
$studentInfo['Class'] = 6; 
$studentInfo['RollNumber'] = 71; 
$studentInfo['Contact'] = "muhammad@gmail.com"; 
foreach($studentInfo as $key => $value) { 
 echo $key.": ".$value."\n"; 
}
```
Here is the output of the code:
```
Name: muhammad 
Age: 11 
Class: 6 
RollNumber: 71 
Contact: muhammad@gmail.com 
```
Here we are using each key to hold one piece of data. We can add as many keys as we need without any problem. This gives us the flexibility to represent a data structure similar to structure, map, and dictionary using a PHP associative array.

## Multidimensional array
A multidimensional array contains multiple arrays in it. In other words, it is an array of array(s). In this book, we will be using multidimensional arrays in different examples as they are one of the most popular and efficient ways of storing data for graphs and other tree-type data structures. Let us explore the PHP multidimensional array using an example:

```
$players = [];
$players[] = ["Name" => "Ronaldo", "Age" => 31, "Country" => "Portugal", "Team"
=> "Real Madrid"];
$players[] = ["Name" => "Messi", "Age" => 27, "Country" => "Argentina", "Team" =>
"Barcelona"];
$players[] = ["Name" => "Neymar", "Age" => 24, "Country" => "Brazil", "Team" =>
"Barcelona"];
$players[] = ["Name" => "Rooney", "Age" => 30, "Country" => "England", "Team" =>
"Man United"];
foreach($players as $index => $playerInfo) { 
 echo "Info of player # ".($index+1)."\n";
 foreach($playerInfo as $key => $value) { 
 echo $key.": ".$value."\n";
 } 
 echo "\n";
}
```
The example we just saw is an example of a two-dimensional array. As a result, we are using two foreach loops to iterate the two-dimensional array.
Here is the output of the code:
```
Info of player # 1 
Name: Ronaldo 
Age: 31 
Country: Portugal 
Team: Real Madrid 
Info of player # 2 
Name: Messi 
Age: 27 
Country: Argentina 
Team: Barcelona 
Info of player # 3 
Name: Neymar 
Age: 24 
Country: Brazil 
Team: Barcelona 
Info of player # 4 
Name: Rooney 
Age: 30 
Country: England 
Team: Man United
```
